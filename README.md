# An-Overview-of-IBM-Cloud-Object-Storage

Object Storage is a ubiquitous element of storage in the cloud and the IBM Cloud is no exception. It offers both reliable and cheap storage for files but there are lots of different options to consider and lots to know in order to get the best from it.

I am an IBM Cloud Technical Subject Matter Expert, working in the UK and over the past couple of years, I’ve gotten to know IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) pretty well, having created a few ‘how-to’ guides and videos on the subject. 

I’ve created this document as a higher-level guide to help users to better understand what IBM Cloud Object Storage is and the various options that are available to help them get going. It’s not exhaustive and isn’t intended to be a substitute for the official documentation (which can be found at https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/about-cos.html#about-ibm-cloud-object-storage) but hopefully it provides a decent ‘getting started’ guide to help build knowledge for first time or novice users.

Comments and feedback are welcome – if there is something that you’d like to see covered here or covered in more detail, let me know and I’ll look to incorporate it into a later version. 

Cheers,

James
